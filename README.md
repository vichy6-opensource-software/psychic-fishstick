i.e. python script that calculates critical billing dates for wireless customers


What is zBc? 
zBc is lightweight yet powerful Python script designed to streamline key billing date calculations for post-paid wireless customers. By taking a single input date, zBc intelligently determines crucial billing milestones within the carrier's cycle, such as billing cycle start dates, app notification dates, billing cycle due dates, billing cycle past due dates, 2 day notification of upcoming AutoPay debit, grace periods, and payment deadlines, ensuring users stay ahead of their financial obligations while staying connected. 
For those who prioritize security or for enterprise applications zBc offers AES-256 GCM encryption, providing a highly secure method to handle sensitive billing data without compromising performance. Built with simplicity and efficiency in mind, this script eliminates the guesswork in billing cycles while keeping operations smooth and automated.

Whether you're a consumer looking for better billing clarity or an Account Associate aiming to optimize workflow, zBc is a reliable, low-footprint solution that gets the job done with minimal setup.

cool nerdy stuff about the script:
Scalability: The code is modular and uses the argparse library for command-line flexibility. Functions like calculate_billing_dates can be imported into larger systems.

Security: The script implements AES-256 encryption (using AESGCM) and secure key derivation via PBKDF2.
Open Source & Extensible:Written in Python with clear documentation and inline comments to help opensource developers integrate or extend functionality in enterprise telecomunications applications.

Telecommunications Tailoring: Specifically configured to calculate the billing milestones for post-paid (i.e. bill current) customers.

Disclaimer: This script is just a helpful tool—nothing official, no corporate ties. It’s here to make life a little easier by highlighting key billing dates, but it comes as is—no promises, no guarantees. Use it at your own discretion, and if you need the real deal on billing, always check with your provider. Enjoy, and keep things easy. ;-)

zBc is licensed under the Apache 2.0 framework etc.
